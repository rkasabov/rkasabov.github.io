				<h2 align="center" style="font-family:Arial">The BMW E46 3 Series</h2>

				<!--Informational reference: http://www.bmwinfo.com/23400.html-->
				<p align="justify">The fouth generation 3 series known as the E46 was first introduced in 1998.It featured a new modern looking design, 
					taking hints from the previous E36 generation
					whilst ridding itself of the boxyness that was present in the previous generations of the 3 series. 
					The interior had a much more modern look adopted from the E39 5-series and the engines blocks were
					updated to an aluminum cast. The higher price of the new 3 series did not matter, it sold well from the start. </p>

				<p align="justify">There were five models available: 318i, 320i, 323i, 328i and the 320d diesel. 
					All were six cylinders except the 318i and the 320d diesel which were 4 cylinders. 
					Only one year after introduction of the sedan, BMW introduced the new coupe and 
					the new touring. All were available with the same engines as the sedan although 
					the coupe did not have 4 cylinders. This means it was only available as 320Ci, 
					323Ci and 328Ci. BMW also introduced a new 4 cylinder engine for the sedan. 
					This was the 316i with 105 HP but maybe more important was the arrival of the 
					new six cylinder diesel, the 330d. It had 184 HP and a top speed of 230 km/h! </p>

				<p align="justify">Before summer 2000 started, BMW had their new convertible ready. First available 
					as 323Ci only since BMW was about to replace the 2.8 engine with a new 231 HP 
					strong 3.0 engine! This engine replaced all 2.8 engines so all models received it. 
					With this new engine, BMW decided it was time to introduce four wheel drive again. 
					The last four wheel drive 3 series was available in 1991 as 325ix in the E30 3 series. 
					Named 330xi, it was only available as sedan or touring. BMW must have thought it 
					would sell more four wheel drive cars as a 325xi and a 330xd diesel followed soon. 
					But before this happened, BMW replaced the 323i with the 325i, which had 193 HP. 
					The same engine would also be used in the compact, which was introduced in 2001. </p>

				<p align="justify">This new baby BMW was not like any other 3 series but had a whole new look! 
					It had double, round head lights and clear rear lights which looked a bit strange. 
					The interior, however, was just like any other 3 series and it also received the 
					same engines as the sedan had. The news did not last long as BMW decided the 
					sedan and touring needed a face lift. Both front and rear received new lights 
					and bumpers while the interior received a new navigation unit. More important 
					were the engine updates: the 318i received the new valvetronic engine and the 
					320d diesel now had common rail. BMW also introduced a 318d diesel. </p>

			<p style="font-size:15px">Although these cars are loved by many, they aren't without their common flaws.
				<br>Here are some of the 10 common problems we have experiences in our E46s:</p>
		</div>
		<div id="page">


			<ol style="font-family:Palatino;font-size:14px;">
				<li>Floor at rear subframe mounts prone to cracking, especially on M3's under heavy acceleration.<br/><br/></li>
				<li>Cooling system components tend to wear out resulting in a catastrophic failure if not changed in time.<br/><br/></li>
				<li>Valve cover gasket tends to start leaking after around 100,000km, oil filter housing gasket is prone as well.<br/><br/></li>
				<li>Window regulators tend to fail at high mileage, initially making a clicking noise when you row down windows.<br/><br/></li>
				<li>Control arm bushings tend to go after around 2-4 years of driving, resulting in steering pull on uneven ground.<br/><br/></li>
				<li>Power steering hoses connecting to the P/S filter leak on most used E46's.<br/><br/></li>
				<li>Interior weatherstripping tends to peel off with this happening to some models when they were brand new.<br/><br/></li>
				<li>Weatherstripping dries out on most high mileage models, resulting in water leaking in door sills and wind noise.<br/><br/></li>
				<li>The wooden deck above the Harman Kardon subwoofers on the coupe tends to rattle on older models.<br/><br/></li>
				<li>Rear trunk elephant loom wiring gets freyed after many years of opening and closing the trunk and bending the wires.<br/><br/></li>
			</ol>
